        <h1 class="textAnim">The Bowling Club</h1>
        <p> The earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt, with wall drawings depicting bowling being found in a royal Egyptian
            tomb dated to 5200 B.C.and miniature pins and balls in an Egyptian child's grave about 5200 B.C.
            Remnants of bowling balls were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC. 
            What is thought to be a child's game involving porphyry (stone) balls, a miniature trilithon, and nine breccia-veined alabaster vase-shaped figures—thought 
            to resemble the more modern game of skittles—was found in Naqada, Egypt in 1895.
            In 1511, English King Henry VIII was an avid bowler. He banned bowling for the lower classes and imposed a levy for private lanes to limit them to the wealthy.<br><br>
            Another English law, passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845), prohibited workers from bowling, except at Christmas, and only in their master's home and in his presence.
            In 1530 he acquired Whitehall Palace in central London as his new residence, having it extensively rebuilt complete with outdoor bowling lanes, indoor tennis court,
            jousting tiltyard, and cockfighting pit. Bowling balls vary, depending on the type of bowling game. Ten-pin balls are large, up to 27 inches (69 cm) in circumference 
            and approximately 8.59 inches (21.8 cm) in diameter, and have as many as twelve holes, typically three holes.<br><br>
            The balls come in various weights from 6 to 16 lb (2.7 to 7.3 kg), with the size and spacing of the finger holes often smaller on lighter balls to accommodate smaller hands. 
            Different kinds of balls are available for different styles of bowling. There are balls for hook shots and balls for bowling straight. 
            The bowling balls meant for hook shots have different core shapes and different chemical covers. There are a few types of chemical covers that allow a bowling ball to hook more.
            Remnants of bowling balls were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC.</p>
